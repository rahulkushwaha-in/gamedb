        >Just released with all new NodeJS best practices and trends for 2022!
        Join a live online community of over 600,000+ developers and a course
        taught by industry experts that have actually worked both in Silicon
        Valley and Toronto with Node.js.</strong
      >
      <br /><br />Using the latest version of Node, this course is focused on
      efficiency and turning you into a Back End or Fullstack developer. Never
      spend time on confusing, out of date, incomplete tutorials anymore!
      <strong
        >Graduates of Andrei’s courses are now working at Google, Tesla, Amazon,
        Apple, IBM, JP Morgan, Facebook, + other top tech companies for a
        reason.</strong
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      We guarantee you this is the most comprehensive online resource on NodeJS.
      This project based course will introduce you to all of the modern
      toolchain of a Node JS developer in 2022. Along the way, we will build a
      massive NASA&nbsp;Space launch application using&nbsp;Node.js, Express
      Framework, RESTful APIs, GraphQL, and much more! This is going to be a
      Fullstack MERN&nbsp;app. We will also build many other mini projects along
      the way so you feel confident deploying any Node.js project to production
      in the future by yourself!
    </p>
    <p><br /></p>
    <p>
      <strong
        >All code is going to be provided step by step and even if you don’t
        like to code along, you will get access to all the code from the
        projects we build so anyone signed up for the course will have their own
        project to put on their portfolio right away.</strong
      >
    </p>
    <p><br /></p>
    <p>
      The curriculum is going to be very hands on as we walk you from start to
      finish of releasing a professional (performant and secure) Node.js project
      all the way into production.&nbsp;We will start from the very beginning by
      teaching you Node basics and then going into advanced topics so you can
      make good decisions on architecture and tools on any of your future NodeJS
      projects. The goal is to turn you into a senior backend developer!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />Finally, this course will be constantly evolving and updating as the
      landscape changes. Just as the Node ecosystem evolves, we want
      <strong
        >this course to be constantly updated with lectures and resource for you
        to come back to, in order to find the latest Node best practices anytime
        in the future.<br /></strong

      This course is not about making you just code along without understanding
      the principles so that when you are done with the course you don’t know
      what to do other than watch another tutorial. No!
      <strong
        >This course will push you and challenge you to go from an absolute
        beginner in NodeJS to someone that is in the top 10% of NodeJS backend
        developers.&nbsp;</strong

    <p>
      <strong>Andrei&nbsp;Neagoie</strong> is the instructor of the
      <strong
        >highest rated Development courses on Udemy as well as&nbsp;one of the
        fastest&nbsp;growing.&nbsp;</strong
      >His graduates have&nbsp;moved&nbsp;on to work for&nbsp;some of the
      biggest tech&nbsp;companies around the world like Apple, Google, Amazon,
      JP Morgan, IBM, UNIQLO etc...&nbsp;He&nbsp;has&nbsp;been working as a
      senior software developer in&nbsp;Silicon Valley and Toronto for many
      years,&nbsp;and&nbsp;is now taking all that he has learned,&nbsp;to
      teach&nbsp;programming skills and&nbsp;to help you&nbsp;discover the
      amazing career opportunities that being a developer allows
      in&nbsp;life.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      Having been&nbsp;a self taught programmer,&nbsp;he understands that there
      is an&nbsp;overwhelming number of online courses, tutorials and
      books&nbsp;that are overly verbose and inadequate at teaching proper
      skills.&nbsp;Most people feel paralyzed and don't know where to start when
      learning a complex subject matter, or even worse, most people don't have
      $20,000 to spend on a coding bootcamp.&nbsp;<strong
        >Programming skills should be affordable and open to all. An education
        material&nbsp;should teach real life skills that are current
        and&nbsp;they should not waste a student's valuable time.</strong
      >&nbsp;&nbsp; Having learned important&nbsp;lessons from working for
      Fortune 500 companies, tech startups, to even&nbsp;founding his own
      business, he is now dedicating 100% of his time to&nbsp;teaching others
      valuable&nbsp;software development skills&nbsp;in order to take control of
      their life and work in an exciting industry with infinite
      possibilities.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      Andrei promises you that there are no other courses out there as
      comprehensive and as well explained.&nbsp;<strong
        >He believes that in order to learn anything of value, you need to start
        with the foundation and develop the roots of the tree. Only from there
        will you be able to learn concepts and specific skills(leaves) that
        connect to the foundation. Learning becomes exponential when structured
        in this way.</strong
      >&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      Taking his experience in educational psychology and coding, Andrei's
      courses will take you on an understanding of complex subjects that you
      never thought would be possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;
